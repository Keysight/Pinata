The above commit seems to most closely match "NIST Submission Round 3" of the reference implementation. The reference implementation can be found at

https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium

There seems to be no git tag for Round 3. However, there is a git tag for "v3.1". The "NIST Submission Round 3" seems to correspond to the code just before "v3.1".
